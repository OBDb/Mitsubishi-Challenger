generations:
  - name: "First Generation (K90/PA)"
    start_year: 1996
    end_year: 2008
    description: "The original Mitsubishi Challenger (known as Pajero Sport or Montero Sport in many markets) was introduced as a mid-size SUV based on the Mitsubishi Triton/L200 pickup truck platform. Featuring body-on-frame construction with a shortened wheelbase compared to the Triton, it offered genuine off-road capability with available four-wheel drive including low-range gearing. The exterior design maintained rugged styling cues with pronounced wheel arches, substantial ground clearance, and a prominent front end. Powertrain options varied by market but typically included a 2.5L turbodiesel and a range of gasoline engines including a 3.0L V6, paired with either manual or automatic transmissions. The suspension utilized independent double wishbones at the front and leaf springs at the rear, balancing off-road articulation with reasonable on-road comfort. The interior featured straightforward, durable design with seating for five passengers in standard form, though some markets received seven-seat variants with a third row. Equipment levels varied widely by market, from basic utility-focused versions to more luxurious variants with leather upholstery, power accessories, and premium audio. Though less refined than some competitors, the first-generation Challenger/Pajero Sport built a reputation for durability and off-road capability, particularly in developing markets where these attributes were highly valued."

  - name: "Second Generation (KH)"
    start_year: 2008
    end_year: 2015
    description: "The second-generation Challenger continued its relationship with the Triton/L200 pickup, adopting more modern styling while maintaining its rugged body-on-frame construction. The exterior featured Mitsubishi's then-current design language with a bold front fascia, flared wheel arches, and distinctive character lines running along the sides. Available in both five and seven-seat configurations, it offered improved interior space and comfort compared to its predecessor. Powertrain options again varied by market, with most regions receiving a 2.5L turbodiesel engine producing approximately 178 horsepower, while some markets also offered V6 gasoline options. Transmission choices included a five-speed manual or five-speed automatic, with four-wheel drive systems featuring Super Select II or Easy Select depending on specification, both offering low-range capability for serious off-road use. The suspension was refined with a new rear multi-link setup replacing the previous leaf springs, significantly improving on-road ride quality while maintaining off-road articulation. The interior saw substantial improvements in design, material quality, and features, with higher trim levels offering touchscreen navigation, leather upholstery, and advanced safety equipment. Despite these refinements, the second-generation maintained its focus on durability and off-road capability, positioning it as a more rugged alternative to increasingly road-focused crossover SUVs. The model achieved particular success in Southeast Asia, Australia, the Middle East, and Latin America, markets where its combination of toughness, practicality, and reasonable comfort was especially valued."

  - name: "Third Generation (QF/QG)"
    start_year: 2016
    end_year: null
    description: "The third generation, now universally known as the Pajero Sport/Montero Sport with the Challenger name discontinued in most markets, represents a significant advancement in design, technology, and refinement while maintaining its body-on-frame construction and off-road focus. Built on an updated version of the Triton/L200 platform, it features dramatically different styling with Mitsubishi's 'Dynamic Shield' front design, distinctive vertical taillights extending from the rear pillars, and a more sculpted overall appearance. Powertrain options center around a 2.4L MIVEC turbodiesel producing approximately 180 horsepower and 430 Nm of torque in most markets, paired with a new 8-speed automatic transmission (replacing the previous 5-speed), though some regions receive alternative engine options including gasoline variants. The four-wheel drive system was upgraded to Super Select 4WD-II with improved off-road electronics including hill descent control, terrain selection modes, and an off-road traction control system. Available in both five and seven-seat configurations, the third generation offers significantly improved interior quality with soft-touch materials, piano black and silver accents, and available leather upholstery. Technology features include an 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system, multi-around view monitor, and on later models, a digital instrument cluster. Safety technology expanded substantially with the addition of Forward Collision Mitigation, Blind Spot Warning, and Ultrasonic Misacceleration Mitigation System. A facelift in 2019 brought updated styling, enhanced technology including smartphone integration, and additional driver assistance features. This generation successfully bridges the gap between rugged capability and everyday refinement, maintaining the model's appeal in developing markets while offering a more sophisticated package to compete with increasingly premium competitors."
